# mapping-houses-neighbourhoods
This repository cover a project which is involves a dataset of a house attributes and their prices are used for visualizing these houses for their coordinates and data manipulating. 

In this project we can observe if the house we have coordinates of is in a neighbourhood or not. I only managed to compile a data for Istanbul's neighbourhoods but it would work for any border in the world.

As you can see:

In the Pendik Şeyhli neighbourhood, there are 12 houses out of the border which are listed as IN the Şeyhli neighbourhood but are not. 


Green:   the house is within 100m diameter

Orange:  the house is within 400m diameter

Red:     the house is within 750m diameter

Black:   the house is not in 750m diameter

Here is another example of the map from Pendik - Yayalar
